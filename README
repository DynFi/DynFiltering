# About the DynFiltering project 

DynFiltering is a research and development project which has been initiated by DynFi with Central Paristech school (a French based engineering school).  
The goal of this project is to explore the possibilities offered by large scale filtering based on SSL fingerprinting based on certificate signature. 

The various scripts and tools found in this project should allow one to parse a large number of URL, efficiently save the SSL signatures in a database and produce lists of SSL fingerprint ready to be imported in Suricata.
