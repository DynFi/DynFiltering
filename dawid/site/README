To run the website, we always decided to use "screen" so that our terminal did not become useless

we did the following in the terminal:

###################
screen -r   (to open a screen session)

export FLASK_APP=hello.py

flask run --host=0.0.0.0   (start the webserver)
###################

You can also make the site in https run "python3 -m flask -run --help" to know more about the certificates


The "hello.py" file contains the Flask application
The templates folder contains the html template (jinja2)
The "flask_celery.py" file contains tools from the Celery documentation however we are uncertain of how the Celery app completely works. (and if it actually works)
